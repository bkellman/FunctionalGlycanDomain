# FunctionalGlycanDomain

Authors: Ben Kellman and Bokan Bao

## Objective: Functional Glycan Annotation
- Association of glycans with functions through covalent and lectin interactions
-- SugarDB - lectin:glycan interactions
-- unicarbKB - glycoprotein:glycan interactions
-- Paulsson Cummumings (?) - glycan arrays (which glycans are bound by a given lectin?)

- Generalization of glycan:function associations to motifs contained in those glycans
-- Leverage existing motif search tools: MCAW
-- Develop internal motif search tools based on network motif search (resolves limitations of MCAW induced by pre-filtration step)

- Annotate unknown glycans by their motifs
-- Glytoucan glycans not found in annotation databases
-- Generate theoretical glycans using metabolic models
